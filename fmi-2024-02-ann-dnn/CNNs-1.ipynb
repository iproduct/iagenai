    "\n",
    "This notebook is provided as a “behind-the-scenes” look at code used to make some of the figures in this chapter. It is cleaned up a bit from the original code that I hacked together, and is only lightly commented. I wrote the code to be easy to interpret and understand, even for those who are new to Python. I tried never to be clever or even more efficient at the cost of being harder to understand. The code is in Python3, using the versions of libraries as of April 2021. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook may contain additional code to create models and images not in the book. That material is included here to demonstrate additional techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that I've included the output cells in this saved notebook, but Jupyter doesn't save the variables or data that were used to generate them. To recreate any cell's output, evaluate all the cells from the start up to that cell. A convenient way to experiment is to first choose \"Restart & Run All\" from the Kernel menu, so that everything's been defined and is up to date. Then you can experiment using the variables, data, functions, and other stuff defined in this notebook."
